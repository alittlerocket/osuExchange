"# auth.py"

This code handles the entirety of the OAuth2 Authorization flow for the
osu! API

"Modules and what they are used for":
- http.server.HTTPServer and http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler are used to create the local server.
- requests.post is used to send HTTP POST requests.
- sys.exit is used to terminate the script.
- urllib.parse.urlencode, urllib.parse.urlparse, and urllib.parse.parse_qs are used for URL parsing.
- webbrowser is used to open a web browser for the authorization process.
json is used to handle JSON data.

client ID and client secret:

    What is it?

        A client_secret is a confidential value used in OAuth2 authentication to identify and authenticate a client application. You use it in combination with a client_id to verify the identity and permissions of the client application when interacting with an OAuth2 server.

        Think about it like an additional layer of security to the authentication process.

    For the code, I provided my own client_id and client_secret, and I don't really care if you guys know about it. However, if you would like to learn how to obtain these. You can follow the steps that I wrote in this Google Doc link:

Server Details:

    We are going to be running the server on our local machine. In order to tell the computer that, we indicate 'HOST' as 'localhost'. The exact 'PORT' number that the server will use to listen for any incoming requests is arbitrary, but because I'm funny, we're using '6969'

Defining redirect_uri:

    We are going to set the redirect_uri to http://localhost:6969

    This is a URI that the OAuth2 provider, the page that basically wants you to authenticate or whatever, gives that will redirect the user after they click authorize (or cancel).

    If you try to redirect the user without specifying the 'Application Callback URLs' on the osu! website, it will not work. Also, the serve must be running, obviously.

Specifying the token and Auth endpoints:

    The auth_endpoint is set to https://osu.ppy.sh/oauth/authorize. It is the base URL where the user will be redirected for the authorization process (there are some query parameters attached to the end of the link, but this is the base).

    After filling out the necessary parameters, we can make a get request with this information. If the user accepts the authorization, then we will be given an authorization code which can then be traded in for an access token in the following steps.

    The token_endpoint is set to https://osu.ppy.sh/oauth/token. It is the base URL where the server will send a request to exchange the authorization code for an access token.

    What do we use the access token for?

        An access token is a credential that is used to authenticate and authorize requests made by a client application to access protected resources on a server. It is a security token that grants access permissions for a specific user or client application. 
        
        Because we have it, we have permission to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

Making ReqHandler and inheriting it from BaseHTTPRequestHandler:

    Inheriting from BaseHTTPRequestHandler allows us to access functions like do_GET and do_POST so we have customization of how we handle the "GET" and "POST" requests. 
    
    In our case, we're using GET requests to retrieve data from a server and POST to submit our authorization code to process our access token.

    do_OPTIONS is mainly there so we don't do a second GET request, because Google probably is making GET requests in the background when it's caching stuff and tracking you.

    do_GET is overridden to basically do all the heavy lifting. It gets the authorization code, trades it in with the help of "exchange_authorization_code", which sends the correct POST request with all the required parameters, and gets the access token.

        If you would like to learn more about the kinds of parameters they need, I highly suggest reviewing the osu!web documentation on the exchanging of the authorization code for an access token.
    
    Access tokens have expirations. In our case, 84600 seconds is about 23.5 hours. So we can use the refresh_access_token method to refresh our access code without the need of going through the whole authentication process again if we ever need it.

run_server:

    run_server function will create an HTTPServer object as specified by global variables HOST and PORT with ReqHandler as the request handler. We can use serve_forever to start it up and continue until we Ctrl+C out of it.
